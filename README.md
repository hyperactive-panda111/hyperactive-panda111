# Hey, I'm Yaw 👋

Backend engineer from Accra, Ghana, specializing in **distributed systems** and **scalable SaaS architectures**. I build resilient, low-latency systems and solve concurrency challenges in production environments.

## 🔧 What I Work With

**Languages & Runtimes**  
TypeScript • Node.js • C

**Databases & ORMs**  
PostgreSQL • MongoDB • Prisma

**Frameworks & Tools**  
Hono.js • Express • tRPC • Inngest

**Infrastructure & Services**  
Stripe • Sentry • Cloudinary • Vercel • CI/CD Pipelines

## 💼 What I've Built

**Workflow Automation Platform**  
End-to-end SaaS enabling users to orchestrate distributed background jobs and AI integrations through a visual workflow builder.
- Architected workflow orchestration engine with durable job execution using Inngest
- Built unified AI integration layer abstracting OpenAI, Claude, and Gemini APIs with rate-limit handling
- Implemented full SaaS infrastructure: auth, billing, error tracking, and type-safe API layer

**Software-Based 3D Graphics Engine** • [View Project](https://github.com/hyperactive-panda111/3d-software-renderer)  
CPU-based graphics pipeline built from scratch without any graphics APIs.
- Implemented complete rendering pipeline in C: perspective projection, Z-buffering, texture mapping, and lighting
- Achieved 30 FPS rendering of 10,000 vertices through backface culling, frustum clipping, and cache-optimized data layout
- Built OBJ model loader and perspective-correct texture mapping for realistic rendering
- Improved CPU performance by 50% with low-level memory optimizations

**Chirp - Full-Stack Social Media Platform** • [View Project](https://github.com/hyperactive-panda111/chirp)  
Modern social media application with real-time capabilities and infinite scrolling.
- Built full authentication system with Clerk and user profile management
- Implemented infinite-scrolling feed with React Query for optimized data fetching
- Integrated ImageKit for scalable image hosting and Prisma ORM with Neon PostgreSQL
- Designed responsive UI with Tailwind CSS and Socket.IO infrastructure for real-time features

## 📊 Impact Highlights

- Reduced PostgreSQL load by **70%** with debounce-based autosave optimization
- Improved CPU rendering performance by **50%** through algrorithmic improvements
- Built concurrency-safe Stripe webhook infrastructure for reliable billing
- Designed zero-downtime CI/CD pipelines on Vercel
